# Titanic---Machine-Learning-from-Disaster
INTRODUCTIONÂ¶
**In this notebook, I explored 9 different models to gain insights into various algorithms and identify which one delivers the best accuracy. As a beginner, this project serves as a valuable learning experience, and I have detailed the Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) ðŸ“Š to enhance understanding.

The EDA process involved analyzing the Titanic dataset to uncover trends, patterns, and relationships within the data. By examining factors such as passenger demographics, ticket class, and survival rates, I was able to identify key features that significantly influenced survival. This analysis not only guided feature selection but also highlighted the importance of cleaning and preprocessing the data to ensure that the models could perform optimally. For instance, handling missing values and encoding categorical variables allowed the algorithms to interpret the data effectively, leading to better predictions.

The models used in this project are:**
